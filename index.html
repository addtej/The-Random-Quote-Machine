That it hasn't all been that way is simply down to some random quirk of fate.", "Maybe life is random, but I doubt it." , "Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn't matter to me. Going to bed at night saying we've done something wonderful, that's what matters to me." , "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like.

A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them." , "Sometimes life is going to hit you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.", "Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose." , "I really had a lot of dreams when I was a kid, and I think a great deal of that grew out of the fact that I had a chance to read a lot." , "In a world that's changing really quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks"
